# Multi-layer Perceptron

In this repository, a complete set of Jupyter notebook and python scripts is prepared for investigating almost all effective  factors in designing a Multi-layer Perceptron model.

# Usage
In the jupyter notebook, some experiemnts are designed to be applied on farsi OCR dataset. As its name implies, it is like famous MNIST dataset but it consists of images of handwritten digits in farsi. By running these experiments, you can figure out how factors of

  1. Regularization techniques
  2. Activation functions
  3. Number of layer and units
  4. Initialization

affects the result of learning process.

Alongside the notebook, there some python files with TODO sections filled with proper lines of code. For Each TODO section, a comprehensive description of the required code is provided.
